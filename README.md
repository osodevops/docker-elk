# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker
The Elastic stack (ELK) powered by Docker and Compose.

Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/master/docker)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/dev/build/tasks/os_packages/docker_generator)

## Environment startup

The environment deploys 1 Elasticsearch and 1 Kibana node and 1 Logstash to start this example you can run the following:

To start the environment run:

```console
$ docker-compose up --build
```


You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by adding the `-d` flag to the above command.

### Cleanup

Elasticsearch data is persisted inside a volume by default.

In order to entirely shutdown the stack and remove all persisted data, use the following Docker Compose command:

```console
$ docker-compose down -v
```
## Initial setup

### Setting up user authentication

*:information_source: Refer to [How to disable paid features](#how-to-disable-paid-features) to disable authentication.*

The stack is pre-configured with the following **privileged** bootstrap user:

* user: *elastic*
* password: *changeme*

Although all stack components work out-of-the-box with this user, we strongly recommend using the unprivileged [built-in
users][builtin-users] instead for increased security.
